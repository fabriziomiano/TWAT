# What is this? 
This is a tool that [@labaffa](https://github.com/labaffa) and I developed while I was finishing my PhD at University of Sussex and CERN. This tool essentially monitors the size of the so-called ATLAS Trigger Event Data Model. Every time it runs, it creates, or updates, an archive that serves a webpage where the results of the monitoring are displayed. Finally, under certain conditions, it sends an email with the results of the monitoring, if an alert has to be produced.
